# Date: 10/14/22
# Purpose: Demonstrative printing exercise
# Study Drills:
# 1. Make script print another line
# 2. Make script print only one line
# 3. Put a # at the beginning of a line. This is the comment
#    Character, everything in the line after the #is ignored by
#    The interpreter.

# print("Hello World!")
# print("Hello Again")
# print("I like typing this.")
# print("This is fun.")
# print('Yay! Printing.')
# print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
# print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print('This is the last line') # only this line will print, the others are commented out.
